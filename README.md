# Computational-Musicology- 
My research for this course will constitute of examining the corpus of popular Balkan music. Stemming from this conflicting region, I have been exposed to various kinds of its music, which I believe has a rather distinguishable quality carefully observed by its active listeners. I will, thus, like to learn if I can approach this quality scientifically and find a way to properly detect its features and analyse them. 
My corpus will feature well known songs from different Balkan countries – Serbia, Croatia, Albania, Greece, and Bulgaria. I expect to find similar levels of danceability from all groups, yet differences in other aspects. The songs themselves will be selected and assessed based on their popularity, which will be checked on both Spotify and YouTube. In this way, I could assess if overall similar musical features lead to success in all the Balkan countries, thus, confirming a homogeneity of musical taste across this region. 
To get a narrower picture, I will only select songs that were most successful in the last 10 years. For instance, the Serbian part of the corpus will feature turbofolk classics on one hand, but also an unusual Euro Song hit “In Corpore Sano”, which gained immense popularity in the last year. In this way, there will be determined genre versatility, as to simulate the type of omnivore taste held by an average music consumer of a specific Balkan country in question.
